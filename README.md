## Questions and Answers

### 1. In the browser runtime, Javascript is a ...
a. ... compiled language
b. ... transpiled language

Depends on some developers, it's an interpreted language actually because while runtime its interpreted by the client browser but, thanks to JIT compiles code just before execution we can think about it as compiled/interpreted hybrid too. (JIT === Just in Time Compiler)
